# arch-pkgs

**This is my attempt at creating a statically configured Linux Arch installation. I wanted to combine the best of two worlds: static configuration from NixOS with the general support from Arch. It contains the confguration of my machines, therefor it serves as my 'dotfiles'.**

It kind of supports multiple hosts, but not entirely.

My Arch config has been largely abandonded, mostly because of frustration.

## My system (tdpeuter-base)

- **Kernel:** Linux Arch Stable
- **Storage:** LVM
