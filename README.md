# arch-pkgs

**This is my attempt at creating a statically configured Linux Arch installation. I wanted to combine the best of two worlds: static configuration from NixOS with the general support from Arch. It contains the confguration of my machines, therefor it serves as my 'dotfiles'.**

## My system (tdpeuter-base)

- **Kernel:** Linux Arch Stable
- **Storage:** LVM

## Analogy

The analogy is quite simple. 

Over the course of getting to know Linux and during my career as a student, I had to reinstall my OS SO so so many times, either because I bricked my previous install, or because things weren't working the way I wanted them to or even because I found the current install to be cluttered. On a particular day, I had installed Arch over ten times, which is my personal record of most-installed-computers-in-one-day so far. I also managed to speedrun the installation process to 8min30sec for the kernel with an additional 4min30sec for installing Sway (fun fact/did you know?). 

Later, this worsened even more when I had way to much fun playing around with the machine configuration. (Managing disks is prone to errors!) I hope my addaction to break my laptop will ease with this repo: a static configuration that can be installed with as little input as (reasonably) possible.

Discovering Linux was a tedious process and I had to start over several times, hence the analogy with [Sisyphus, greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). 

*But also because it sounds cool and it has the sys from sytem in the name, don't tell anyone this though.*
