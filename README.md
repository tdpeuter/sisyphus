# sisyphus

This repository serves as my dotfiles. It contains the configuration for my Linux machine(s), for multiple distributions. Not everything might be up to date and/or working, so don't expect a working machine if you try to use this configuration for your own machines. However, feel free to steal some parts or be inspired.

- [Arch Linux](./arch) (+ [stow](./stow))
- [Nixos](./nixos)

## Analogy

The analogy is quite simple. 

Over the course of getting to know Linux and during my career as a student, I had to reinstall my OS SO so so many times, either because I bricked my previous install, or because things weren't working the way I wanted them to or even because I found the current install to be cluttered. On a particular day, I had installed Arch (that's what I started with back then) over ten times, which is my personal record of most-installed-computers-in-one-day so far. I also managed to speedrun the installation process to 8min30sec for the kernel with an additional 4min30sec for installing Sway (fun fact/did you know?). 

Later, this worsened even more when I had way too much fun playing around with the machine configuration. (Managing disks is prone to errors!) I hope my addaction to breaking my laptop will ease with this repo: keeping everything easily accessible, often statically configured, so that it can be installed with as little input as (reasonably) possible.

TL;DR: Discovering Linux was a tedious process and I had to start over several times, hence the analogy with [Sisyphus, greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). 

*But also because it sounds cool and it has the sys from sytem in the name, don't tell anyone this though.*
