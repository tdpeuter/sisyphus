# sisyphus

Welcome to my dotfiles repository, named Sisyphus. This repository houses the configurations for my Linux machines, spanning various distributions. Please note that not all configurations may be up-to-date or fully functional. If you decide to use these configurations for your own machines, be prepared for potential issues. Nevertheless, feel free to borrow or draw inspiration from this collection.

## Organisation

To maintain clarity and versatility, I've organized my configuration files into distinct subdirectories. The "bare" configuration files, those you typically find in your `~/.config` directory, are located in [stow](./stow). This separation allows for a streamlined approach to managing configurations, while other subdirectories house OS-specific settings.

- [Arch Linux](./arch) (+ [stow](./stow))
- [NixOS](./nixos)

## The Sisyphus Analogy

The Sisyphus analogy is a straightforward one.

Throughout my journey with Linux, especially during my time as a student, I found myself reinstalling my operating system countless times. Whether it was due to a botched installation, unsatisfactory performance, or simply the desire for a fresh start, I've been there. Things escalated when I began tinkering extensively with machine configurations, often resulting in disk management mishaps. It was clear that I needed to find a way to put an end to these frequent reinstallations, contain my configurations, and maintain system stability. This repository represents my solution to these challenges.

I hope that by maintaining this repository, I can minimize the challenges of breaking my laptop and make configurations easily accessible. They are designed to be relatively static and require as little user input as reasonably possible during installation.

TL;DR: My journey with Linux was a challenging one, marked by frequent restarts, which is why I chose the name Sisyphus as an analogy from [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus).

P.S. While the name "Sisyphus" has a deep mythological significance, it also sounds cool and conveniently contains "sys" from "system" in its name. But, let's keep that our little secret, shall we?
